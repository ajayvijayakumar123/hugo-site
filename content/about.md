## Intro

Welcome to my website! My name is Ajay Vijayakumar (as if you could not tell already lol).
I'm currently a 3rd year CS major at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) concentrating in 
Artifical Intelligence and Computer Networking. I'm actively seeking **summer 2021 internship
opportunities** in full-stack or back-end development.

## Interests

I like journaling and reflecting on my dreams, playing and watching basketball (go Celtics!), and reading.
